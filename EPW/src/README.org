* ~EPW~ modified source
We provide here the following modified source code files for ~EPW v5.1~
that ships with ~Quantum Espresso v6.4.1~:

  - ~ephwann_shuffle.f90~
    Modification: An extra code block has been added to print out the Wigner-Seitz
    vectors and degeneracies that will later be needed in ~elphbolt~.
  
  - ~rigid_epw.f90~
    Modification: The argument of the exponential in a couple of Ewald sums were
    dimensionful. These bugs are fixed.
 
In both these files search for "NHP" to jump to the modified sections.
