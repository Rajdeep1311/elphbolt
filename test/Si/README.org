* Example: Si
** Generate force constants and Wannier data
   - All the input files for the ~Quantum Espresso~ and ~EPW~ calculations are provided in the directory ~qe_and_epw_inputs~.
   - Alternatively, for the time being, you can download input and output data from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V6sbk4T_Qyalw53Y56Gi2mk6_pKvrOeJ/view?usp=sharing. Please note that this link will be removed in the near future since the download size is very large.

** Run ~elphbolt~
   - Runtime: approximately ~3 minutes on 2 cpu cores.

 This is a test calculation for cubic Si to demonstrate the use of ~elphbolt~. Please note that the wave vector meshes in ~input.nml~ are extremely coarse and will not produce converged results for the transport coefficients. For converged results, you must use something along the lines of: ~qmesh = 50 50 50~ and ~mesh_ref = 3~.

 The file /output_gcc.txt/ gives the terminal print of the run.

 This calculation was done on 2 cpu cores of a Lenovo Thinkpad T440 machine running Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS. The code was compiled with ~gcc v9.3.0 (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04)~ and ~OpenCoarrays v2.0.0~.
