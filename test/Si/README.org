* Example: Si

  - Runtime: approximately 3 minutes on 2 cpu cores.

This is a test calculation for cubic Si to demonstrate the use of ~elphbolt~. Please note that the wave vector meshes in ~input.nml~ is extremely coarse and will not produce converged results for the transport coefficients. However, you will be able to run this example on your laptop in under 3 minutes. For converged results, you must use something along the lines of: ~qmesh = 50 50 50~ and ~mesh_ref = 3~.

Look for the file /output_gcc/ for the terminal print of the run. Due to recent changes in the convergence criteria, your transport coefficients may converge faster than in this example.

This calculation was done on 2 cpu cores of a Lenovo Thinkpad T440 machine running Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS. The code was compiled with ~gcc v9.3.0 (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04)~ and ~OpenCoarrays v2.0.0~.
