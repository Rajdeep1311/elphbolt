* elphbolt [v1.0.0 release candidate]
~elphbolt~ (short for electron-phonon Boltzmann transport) is a modern Fortran (2018 standard) code for solving the coupled electron and phonon Boltzmann transport equations (BTEs). You can read about the methodology and implementation here: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08547]]. 

~elphbolt~ is a "free as in freedom" code distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3. You can read more about the philosophy of software freedom here: [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html]].

Using /ab initio/ electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions and a fully wave vector and electron band/phonon branch resolved formulation of the BTEs, ~elphbolt~ can calculate the

- phonon and electronic thermal conductivities;
- electronic conductivity;
- phonon and electronic contributions to the thermopower; and
- effect of the mutual electron-phonon drag on the transport coefficients listed above.

Stylistically, it is designed to be simple, small, fast, and extensible. Object oriented programming concepts are combined with the procedural style, which allows fast development, while resulting in a rather compact source (~ 6700 lines of code). The symmetries of the crystal are fully exploited and the transport active Fermi window is used to allow the sampling of extremely fine wave vector meshes needed for an accurate solution of the BTEs. Parallelism is achieved through modern Fortran's intrinsic ~coarrays~ feature that is fully supported by recent versions of both the ~gcc~ and ~intel~ compilers.

~elphbolt~ currently works with the ~Quantum Espresso~ (https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) suite and its core module ~EPW~ (https://epw-code.org/) for the phonon quantities and the Wannier space information, respectively.

~elphbolt~ is for all of the transport physics community. Feel free to fork and contribute. Create a pull request to incorporate your changes to this project. Tailor it to your own liking/needs and please pay it forward in the spirit of *free software* and *open science*. Let me know of bugs, suggestions for improvement, feature requests, criticism, and praises. You may use the *Discussions* section of this repository for this purpose. There is also a [[https://discord.gg/SZN66GsCHb][discord server]] for informal discussions about theory, set up, usage, extensions, maintenance, possible collaborations, etc. You might find me hanging out there from time to time. I'd love to have a coffee with you and talk physics there in the *office-hour* voice channel.

Current status: v1.0.0 release candidate.
** Documentation

The source is heavily commented and auto-documented with ~FORD~ (https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford). For call graphs and detailed documentation, read ~documentation/index.html~ with your browser. 

** Installation on HPC systems with ~gcc~

*** 1. Get ~spglib~

~elphbolt~ uses the ~spglib~ ([[https://spglib.github.io/spglib/]]) library for crystal symmetry analysis. Currently, versions 1.6.0 and 1.14.1 have been tried and tested. A lot of HPCs provide this library as a module, so check before building from source.

*** 2. Get ~OpenCoarrays~

~OpenCoarrays~ ([[http://www.opencoarrays.org]]) is an implementation of the ~coarrays~ functionalities. Some HPC systems include it (for example, MareNostrum4 (BSC) and LaPalma (IAC)). In that case, load it. If not, you can build it from source. Below are a couple of concrete examples:

I was able to build version 2.0.0 on the LaPalma system of IAC by first loading ~gcc~, ~openmpi~, and ~cmake~, then going into the ~OpenCoarrays-2.0.0~ directory and saying ~./install.sh~. The executables ~caf~ and ~cafrun~ were then installed in ~/OpenCoarrays-2.0.0/prerequisites/installations/bin/~. I added the above directory to my ~$PATH~ in my ~bashrc~.

On the Sirius cluster of Boston College, I was able to build version 2.9.2 by first loading ~gnu_gcc/9.2.0~, ~openmpi/4.0.5gcc9.2.0~, and ~cmake/3.18.4~, then going into the ~OpenCoarrays-2.9.2~ directory and saying ~./install.sh --with-fortran /usr/public/gnu_gcc/9.2.0/bin/gfortran --with-cxx /usr/public/gnu_gcc/9.2.0/bin/g++ --with-c /usr/public/gnu_gcc/9.2.0/bin/gcc --with-mpi /usr/public/openmpi/4.0.5gcc.9.2.0/ --with-cmake /usr/public/cmake/3.18.4/bin/cmake~. The executables ~caf~ and ~cafrun~ were then installed in ~/OpenCoarrays-2.9.2/prerequisites/installations/opencoarrays/2.9.2/bin/~. I added the above directory to my ~$PATH~ in my ~bashrc~. 

Above, you can change the build path with the additional argument ~--install-prefix <path to build directory>~ to ~install.sh~.

*** 3. Create your ~<title>.make~ file

In the ~Makefiles~ directory you will find a few ~<title>.make~ files. Adapt them to your own architecture. Then, in the ~Makefile~ include your personal ~<title>.make~ file at the top, commenting out any exiting one. Copy your ~Makefile~ and ~<title>.make~ files to the ~src/~ directory.

Once you have done the above, go into ~src/~ and simply say ~make~. This should build the executable ~elphbolt.x~ one directory above.

** Tests

A full example for cubic silicon is provided. More examples will be added over time.

** Workflow

This is a transport code. And it comes after doing some DFT, DFPT, and Wannier calculations. Users of the popular ~ShengBTE~ ([[https://bitbucket.org/sousaw/shengbte/src/master/]]) code will find that just one extra step (an ~EPW~ calculation) on top of the ~ShengBTE~ workflow is needed to obtain all the input files necessary for a coupled BTEs calculation with ~elphbolt~. You can, however, calculate just a decoupled phonon or electron BTE, if you so choose. For these, only a subset of the input files will be needed. For example, if you want to calculate just a decoupled electron BTE, then you do not need to provide the third order force constants. Similarly, if you are interested in just a phonon BTE without the phonon-electron interactions, then the Wannier parameters are not required.

Following is the full set of input files:

*** Input file

The input file - ~input.nml~ - contains the information about the crystal and the various parameters of the calculation. A full description of all the input parameters is given in the next section. Also take a look at the ~input.nml~ file for the cubic silicon example.

*** Second order interatomic force constants

This comes out of the usual ~ph.x~ and ~q2r.x~ calculation from ~Quantum Espresso~. This file is needed to calculate phonon quantities and must be named ~espresso.ifc2~.

*** Third order interatomic force constants

This file, which must be named ~FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD~, is needed to calculate the 3-ph scattering rates. This is a required file if you seek a solution of the decoupled phonon BTE or the coupled electron-phonon BTEs.

This must be provided for a solution to the phonon BTE or the coupled electron-phonon BTEs. See documentation for the code ~thirdorder.py~ ([[https://bitbucket.org/sousaw/thirdorder/src/master]]) for how to generate this file.

*** Wannier space information

These are required if you want to solve a decoupled electron BTE, include phonon-electron interaction in the decoupled phonon BTE, or solve the coupled electron-phonon BTEs.

These include the files ~rcells_k~, ~rcells_q~, ~rcells_g~, ~wsdeg_k~, ~wsdeg_q~, and ~wsdeg_g~ which must be printed out of an ~EPW~ calculation. We will also need the files ~epmatwp1~ and ~epwdata.fmt~, both of which are outputted by ~EPW~ after the Bloch -> Wannier calculation step. The first contains the Wannier space electron-phonon matrix elements and the second contains the Wannier space dynamical matrix and Hamiltonian. A couple of modified source files can be found in ~EPW/src/~ directory which are needed to correctly print these quantities out during ~EPW~'s Bloch -> Wannier calculation step. The user must recompile their ~EPW~ code following the replacement with these modified source codes. At this time ~EPW v5.1.0~ (shipped with ~Quantum Espresso v6.4.1~) must be used for this purpose.

*** High symmetry electron and phonon wave vector path and initial electron wave vector

These are required if you want to plot the electronic bands, phonon dispersions, and the electron-phonon matrix elements along high symmetry paths in the Brillouin zone.

You need to provide a wave vector path file named ~highsympath.txt~ (to be used as both the electron and phonon wave vectors) and an initial electron wave vector file named ~initialk.txt~ if you want the electron bands, phonon dispersions, and electron-phonon matrix elements calculated along the path. The first line of ~highsympath.txt~ must be an integer equaling the number of wave vectors in the path. This should be followed by the same number of rows of wave vectors expressed in crystal coordinates (fractions of the reciprocal lattice vectors). The ~initialk.txt~ file must simply contain one wave vector in crystal coordinates.

** Description of ~input.nml~

There are 5 Namelists in the ~input.nml~ file: ~allocations~, ~crystal_info~, ~electrons~, ~numerics~, and ~wannier~. Users of the ~ShengBTE~ code will find the format of this file familiar. Below the keys for each Namelist are described.
